# flipbook_scraper
A small project to build a pdf from flippingbook files. This is meant for your own use, on books you have permission to get the files for. 
This is designed to scrape books from flippingbooks.com and build them into PDF's.
This program requires external modules reportlab, and svglib.
This is a work in progress, and happens over multiple steps. 
Some things can be simplified, such as working on files instead of writing everything to disk, but this is left as a 
way to continue to build functionality for other uses.
